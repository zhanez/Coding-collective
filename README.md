## Description
Coding Collective is a web and mobile responsive application that provides a central hub where coding bootcamp students can connect and collaborate with one another, even after graduation. When we heard that there will be a Slack channel for our cohort after graduation, we realized that we could build something better and more meaningful. Although Slack is helpful as a messaging tool,  it is not designed to help us keep in touch, share resources and provide feedback, since messages disappear pretty quickly.

Recognizing that learning doesnâ€™t stop after graduation, we created the Coding Collective so that we can continue to grow and improve as developers together!

This application was created with the following User Story and Acceptance Criteria in mind:
```
AS a coding bootcamp student
I WANT a central location to connect with other bootcamp students
SO THAT we can network, share projects, and receive feedback
```
```
GIVEN that I want a central location to connect with my bootcamp coding students
WHEN I create an account
THEN my account is saved in the database and I securely log into my community page
WHEN I am brought to my community page
THEN I see a newsfeed of posts shared by my bootcamp classmates and an area to create a new post
WHEN I create a new post
THEN it is saved in MongoDB and it is displayed on the community newsfeed
WHEN I click on my profile
THEN I see my profile picture, about me section, and the github, linkedin, facebook, instagram icons are all linked to my own URLs
WHEN I click on my classmate's name
THEN I see their unique profile
WHEN I am not logged in
THEN I see the "Sign Up" and "Log In" buttons on the Navbar, and I am re-routed to the Sign Up page when I try clicking on the Community or Profile pages 
WHEN I am logged in
THEN I see the "Log Out" button on the Navbar and I can view the Community and Profile pages
```

## Future-Direction
Some future add-ons that would enhance our application include:
- Messaging Function between users 
- Filter categories for posts (e.g., "coding issues", "share content")
- Expand beyond our cohort, so that users can search resources in other cohorts (e.g., 2020 Fall Full-time cohort, 2020-2021 Part-Time cohort)
- Comment section, like/dislike buttons for posts 
- Add edit section for profile
